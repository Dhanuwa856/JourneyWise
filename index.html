          the top travel
          experiences right now.

        <h2>#1: Go on horseback safari in Kenya</h2>
        <img src="assets/card01.avif" alt="">
        <p>A safari in Africa usually conjures an image of mud-spattered 4x4 vehicles bouncing through the bush. But
          there’s another way to travel: on horseback.

        </p>
        <p>Although horse safaris originated in Kenya in the 1970s, they’re a perfect fit for today’s growing number of
          travelers looking for more engaging, sustainable wildlife encounters. At the 32,000-acre Borana Conservancy,
          two stables house thoroughbreds and ex-polo ponies for riders of all skill levels. Visitors can book half-day,
          full-day, or overnight rides. July through September is the prime time to go.

        </p>
        <p>Since wildlife perceive equines as just another animal, exploring the landscape atop a horse makes for an
          intimate experience. “To journey on horseback is to break down the walls—meant to protect but also to
          separate—between oneself and the natural world,” says Nichole Sobecki, a photographer and equestrian who’s
          ridden in Borana. “Your horse is a translator, responding to the low growl of the lion, the soft scent of a
          herd of elephants.” A horse’s ears are an advance warning system, she says, helping knowledgeable guides
          navigate routes.

        <h2>#2: Run an Olympic marathon in Paris</h2>
        <img src="assets/card02.avif" alt="">
        <p>For the first time, members of the public will be able to run their own marathon during the 2024 Summer
          Olympics, in Paris, France, just one initiative aimed at creating a more inclusive Games.



        </p>
        <p>Slated to be held the evening of August 10, between the men’s and women’s official races, the Marathon for
          All will allow 20,024 qualifying lottery winners on the 26.2-mile route that links Paris and Versailles, a
          loop beginning at the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) and passing through nine arrondissements before finishing at
          Les Invalides on the banks of the Seine. Before or after the big event, learn the route to follow in their
          tracks.

        <h2>#3: Bear watch in Katmai National Park
        </h2>
        <img src="assets/card03.avif" alt="">
        <p>Alaska’s Katmai National Park is home to one of the highest concentrations of brown bears in the world. Far
          from the crowded viewing platforms of the Brooks Camp Visitor Center, a guided trip along the Katmai coast
          with outfitters like AK Adventures reveals a different side of the park.

        </p>
        <p>Here, the bears feast on a diversity of foods: sedges, grasses, razor clams, salmon. “For me, seeing a single
          brown bear in the wild is meaningful because it is a sign that the landscape is healthy enough to support it,”
          says Alaska photographer Acacia Johnson, a frequent National Geographic contributor.

        <h2>#4: Cruise an epic river in Colombia

        </h2>
        <img src="assets/card04.avif" alt="">
        <p>About 80 percent of Colombia’s population lives in the river basin of the Magdalena, which flows for nearly a
          thousand miles from the Andes to the Caribbean. AmaWaterways’ new cruises on the river—said to be the first by
          a major cruise operator—take seven-night trips from Cartagena via Mompós to Barranquilla. Stops at colonial
          towns, performances of vallenato and cumbia music, and visits to a stilt-house village highlight the region’s
          culture along this mighty waterway.

        <h2>#5: Road trip Route 66 in New Mexico </h2>
        <img src="assets/card05.avif" alt="">
        <p>For nearly a century, Route 66 has beckoned to travelers. A trip along the Mother Road through New Mexico
          hits timeless landmarks, such as quirky motels and curio shops in and around Tucumcari and symbolic etchings
          in Petroglyph National Monument. In Gallup—mentioned as one of the places to “get your kicks” in Nat King
          Cole’s 1946 hit song “Route 66”—you can take in performances featuring Zuni, Lakota, and Diné (Navajo)
          dancers.


        </p>
        <p>Some 18 miles of the highway traverse Albuquerque, the longest urban interlude of the route in the United
          States. And it’s getting a half-million-dollar glow-up with the ongoing restoration of vintage neon signs
          along Central Avenue.

        </p>
        <p>While cruising down the brightened strip, stop at the new West Central Route 66 Visitor Center, with its
          museum and outdoor amphitheater. The center will host events like lowrider car shows, drive-in movies, and
          artisan markets.

        <h2>#6: Explore ancient art in Algeria
        </h2>
        <img src="assets/card06.avif" alt="">
        <p>Algeria is home to Africa’s largest national park, which holds one of the world’s greatest concentrations of
          ancient rock art. Tassili n’Ajjer National Park is a geologic wonderland of sandstone towers, arches, and
          sculpted outcrops. But these rock forests are only half the story.




        </p>
        <p>Neolithic herders and hunter-gatherers carved 15,000 petroglyphs here, including images of elephants,
          giraffes, and rhinos. These animals are more commonly associated with sub-Saharan Africa—a hint that this arid
          wilderness was once a grassland crisscrossed by waterways. Five- to seven-day guided tours with Fancy Yellow
          take in the most spectacular works of Tassili’s art, like the “Crying Cows,” engraved at the base of a stone
          pinnacle 7,000 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>Travelers with more time might want to combine a trip to Tassili with a visit to the Algerian Sahara’s other
          great geologic marvel: the extraordinary mountain range of Ahaggar National Park.

        <h2>#7: Wander tea trails in Sri Lanka

        </h2>
        <img src="assets/card07.avif" alt="">
        <p>Sri Lanka is virtually synonymous with tea. The island nation is one of the world’s top producers of tea
          leaves. British colonists introduced the first bushes about 200 years ago. Now visitors can trace the
          footsteps of historic planters on the new, nearly 200-mile Pekoe Trail, the country’s first long-distance
          walking route.
        </p>
        <p>Starting just outside Kandy, the trail follows the 19th-century tracks upon which workers and horse-drawn
          carts transported freshly plucked leaves. Hikers pass through hill towns and tea estates and can stop to take
          a cooking class or savor a cup of aromatic Ceylon tea.

        <h2>#8: Raft the rapids in West Virginia


        </h2>
        <img src="assets/card08.avif" alt="">
        <p>Despite its name, West Virginia’s New River is actually one of the oldest on Earth, perhaps as old as 360
          million years. The river falls 750 feet in only 50 miles between sandstone cliffs. It eventually merges with
          the Gauley River. Outfitters such as ACE Adventure Resort can arrange whitewater rafting trips here on Class
          III to V rapids through the longest and deepest river gorge in the Appalachians.

          <p>Brian and I were less than a week into our adventure north when, during a brief phone call, my dear
            friend’s children insisted I read their favorite poem, "the Yukon Song." Though written for children

          <p>Brian and I had spent four days hiking in Tombstone Territorial Park the previous summer on a trip that
            just scratched the surface and whet our appetites for more. Throughout the past year, we dreamed of

          <p>The arctic landscape has an allure that is difficult to describe; not only is it reminiscent of being in
            the alpine—stunted trees, big skies, and unimpeded vistas—but the utter remoteness and rawness is
            palpable...
